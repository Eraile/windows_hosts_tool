## WindowsSetHostnameApp.Properties Namespace

This namespace contains classes that provide access to application resources and settings for the WindowsSetHostnameApp application. It includes strongly typed resource management and a singleton for application settings.

### Notes
The classes within this namespace are auto-generated and facilitate resource retrieval and management of application settings. The Resources class contains a cached instance of ResourceManager, while the Settings class provides a global access point to application settings.
